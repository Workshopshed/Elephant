# Elephant

This ESP32 controlled elephant was created for Diyode Magazine and was published in issue #26 and #28.  Daniel Koch took up the challenge to try to build this from my instructions and in the process we came up with a bunch of enhancements to make it easier to print and assemble. Daniel and Murray Roberts also ensured the wording of the instructions was top notch.

The elephant is controlled from a simple web page hosted on the ESP32 and Ajax calls are used to respond to the buttons.

A spin off project for the servo power distribution board also appeared in issue #26 with Daniel Koch providing a cloned version using stripboard.
